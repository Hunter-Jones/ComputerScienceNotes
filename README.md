# Computer Science Notes
_____

This is a collection of my C++ notes I took. The course notes up until chapter 10 are from classes in University of Akron's Computer Science I course. Any courese notes from chapter 10 and after were from various videos online (links to the videos are in the course Notes).The chapter notes used the textbook **Problem solving with C++ 10th Edition** *By Walter Savitch*. 

## Chapters Included:
------

The coursenotes are from Chapter 4 (When I started taking digital notes rather than physical notes) and goes through chapter 9 (where the class ended) of the book. 
The video coursenotes are from Chapter 10 and beyond.
The C++ book notes (C++ files) go from chapters 8 until the end of the book at chapter 18, but are missing chapter 9.

## How to Run:
-----
These were run using the g++ compiler (GNU C++ Compiler) on Linux and may run into issues when using other environments.
To run compile the file type: 
`g++ Chx.cpp -o ChX`

Once Compiled type:
`./ChX`

EX:
`g++ Ch18.4.cpp -o Ch18.4`
`./Ch18.4`

(Replace the chapter number with whichever other chapter)
Ch12Notes
\*To compile chapter 12, type:
 `g++ Ch12DayOfYear.cpp Ch12Notes.cpp -o Ch12Notes`
 Then compile normallyCh12Notes

## Purpose:
 -----
 This repo was created as a way to backup my notes for archiving purpose. I decided to make them public incase they can help anyone else who is currently learning Computer Science.
