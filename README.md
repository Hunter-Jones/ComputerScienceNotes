# Computer Science Notes
_____

This is a collection of my C++ notes I took in University of Akron's Computer Science I course. It uses the 10th edition of the book **Problem solving with C++** *By Walter Savitch*. 

## Chapters Included:
------

The coursenotes are from Chapter 4 (When I started taking digital notes rather than physical notes) and goes through chapter 9 (where the class ended) of the book. 
The C++ book notes (C++ files) go from chapters 8 and onward, but are missing chapter 9.

## How to Run:
-----
These were run using the g++ compiler (GNU C++ Compiler) and may run into issues when using other compilers, which if you are running on windows, it may require a Linux Subsystem to run.

To run compile the file type: 
`g++ Ch1Notes Ch1Notes`

Once Compiled type:
`./Ch1Notes`

(Replace the chapter number with whichever other chapter)
Ch12Notes
\*To compile chapter 12, type:
 `g++ Ch12DayOfYear.cpp Ch12Notes.cpp -o Ch12Notes`
 Then compile normallyCh12Notes

## Purpose:
 -----
 This repo was created as a way to backup my notes and view them on multiple devices, but I decided to make it public incase it could help anyone else out with learning.
